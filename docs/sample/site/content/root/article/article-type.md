Articles are a content type that is not chronologically ordered like in a blog. Instead, they are self-contained and individual notes. An essay could be a good fit for this type of content.

## Structure and Rendering

- **Non-Chronological**: Articles are not ordered by date.
- **Self-Contained**: Each article stands alone as an individual piece.
- **Root Section**: Articles in the root section are rendered directly under the domain, not under a subdirectory like `/root`.

For organizational purposes, we use a `root` directory to store the markdown files, but the content is rendered directly under the domain. Other sections create a directory with the same name, and the content is rendered under it.
