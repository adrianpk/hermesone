# Content Types

We have different content types to categorize the content on the site:

## Page

Used for site pages, usually for standard static pages like about-us, contact, etc. These are not considered "real" content but more like standard static pages.

## Article

Used for real content. Some articles are not intended to be chronologically accessible as in a blog, for example, an essay or a paper. This type makes sense for this kind of posts/content.

## Blog

Self-explanatory, content ordered chronologically.

## Series

Sometimes we want to group articles in series, such as a guide, a tutorial, or a course. A series of connected and self-contained posts that make sense to organize and make accessible in a series of connected posts. We use the article type for this.

## Example

- `content/root/about-us.md` will be rendered as `domain.tld/about-us.html`.
- `content/guides/article.md` will be rendered as `domain.tld/guides/article.html`.
