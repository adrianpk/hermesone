# Blog Type

Blog posts are a content type that is organized chronologically. This makes them ideal for time-sensitive content and regular updates.

## Structure and Rendering

- **Chronological Order**: Blog posts are ordered by date.
- **Related Content**: The layout may show related content.
- **Blog Section**: Blog posts are rendered under the `/blog` directory.

For organizational purposes, blog posts are stored in a directory named `blog`, and the content is rendered under this directory.
