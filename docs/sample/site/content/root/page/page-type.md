# Page Type

Pages are a content type similar to articles but are not included in indexes. They are used for static and generic content that the site itself uses, such as "About" and "Contact" pages.

## Structure and Rendering

- **Static Content**: Pages are not included in indexes and are used for static, generic content.
- **Root Section**: Pages in the root section are rendered directly under the domain, without an extra path appended to the URL.
- **Shared Space**: Pages share the same space as articles but are used for less important content.

For organizational purposes, pages are stored in the `root` directory or the respective section directory, but the content is rendered directly under the domain or section.
