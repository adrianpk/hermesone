# Series

Series are used to create guides, tutorials, and other related content that is divided into multiple parts due to its length.

## Structure and Rendering

- **Divided Content**: Series are divided into multiple deliveries.
- **Series Path**: Series are rendered under the `/series/` path followed by the `/series-name` and a numbered slug.
- **Contextual Layout**: The layout facilitates navigation between different parts of the series.
